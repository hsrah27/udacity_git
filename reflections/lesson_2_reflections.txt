What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git init turns a folder into a git repository which means that you can start tracking files and changes to those files

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an area where you can stage files to be committed; this allows you to group some files, out of
all of the changed files in the working directory, so that the grouped files can be committed together
