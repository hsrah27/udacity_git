How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Using diff showed me the differences between two files - quickly going through all of the text in the file then just showing me what had changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Having full history to the entire history of a file would allow mistakes to be undone. It would also be a good backup.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
PROS - you can group your commits logically; based on your logic
CONS - you have to remember to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Different VCS are used for different purposes. Google docs just needs to track unrelated files. Git allows you to track interconnected files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows you a log of all commits
you can then compare two commits using git diff
for instance, i could compare one commit with the previous commit to see what changed from the previous one to the next one

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
If you break something, you can always use git checkout <SHA> to go back to a previous working version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
keep track of everything
