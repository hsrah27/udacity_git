When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
remotes are great - they provide backup and accessibility to your files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manually pulling changes allows me to determine when code is brought down. This means that code won't change
unexpectedly without me knowing about it.
